# Simple Splitwise
This project is a basic command line tool to simplify transactions. For now it just supports one to one transaction at time. The data base somewhat models that of the [SPLITWISE](https://www.splitwise.com/) app.

## How does transactions get simplified
Transactions are generated with keeping the count of them minimum in mind. This is done by keeping two heaps.
